The game is simplified remake of galaga. The goal of the game is to shoot the
enemies and survive the levels. Enemies can kill you via shooting you, or running
into you. You can shoot them as well. Enemies can kill themselves by running into
other enemies as well. A(Q on my keyboard) is shoot, Up(up arrow) is go up,
Down(down arrow) is go down, Left(left arrow) is go left, Right(right arrow) is
go right. Each level gets progressively harder, there are 10 levels, level 10 is
a boss. good luck have fun.
